# etch-a-sketch

This project was a nice exercise to prove my newly developed skills
on the DOM, JavaScript and last but not least the interaction between CSS, HTML and JS.

This project uses davidmerfield's randomColor script for the randomAll function, which gets
called twice within the code through both the fill all and the disco buttons.

This project was made as an assignement for The Odin Project (TOP)
